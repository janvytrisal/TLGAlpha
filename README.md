TLG Alpha is 3D platformer with procedural generated levels. I have created this project to get familiar with Unity and game development with game engine. The project is far away from finished, so I will be making changes from time to time.

The game is primary build for android device with accelerometer.

Controls:

Movement: left half of screen. Put finger on a screen and pull in desired direction.

Jump: tap inside rectangle in lower right corner.

Rotating camera: tilt device on left or right to rotate camera 90 degrees.
