## TLG Alpha

TLG Alpha is 3D platformer with procedural generated levels. I have created this project to get familiar with Unity and game development with game engine. The project is far away from finished, so I will be making updates from time to time.

The game is build for android device with accelerometer.

#### Controls:
* Movement: left half of screen. Put finger on a screen and pull in desired direction. Joystick like motion.
* Jump: tap inside rectangle in lower right corner.
* Rotating camera and player: tilt device on left or right to perform 90 degree rotation.

TLG Alpha is under GNU GPL v3 license.
